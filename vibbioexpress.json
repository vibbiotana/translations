      "Storytelling in a short format of maximum 1 minute can be challenging, but when done correctly, the reach and effect can be fantastic. Building engagement and visibility through portioning your content into short, specific episodes – collected into targeted and themed series, is a very smart video strategy – and can be added to over any suitable time period.",

      "This means that it can actually be a real bonus to collect your own clips, by using easygoing camera tools, smartphones and such. Keeping the clips short and specific helps to create a clear message. (We have easy tips & tricks about how to get going.)",
      "The visual clips are the “packaging” and colouring-in of smart videos. The most important element is the content; the message.",
